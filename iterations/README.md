# Earlier iterations

Dead-drop is the fourth attempt at the same problem: letting Claude Code agents working in
different places pass each other what they know, without the user relaying it by hand. The first
two attempts were separate repositories. They were folded in here on 2026-10-22 and the original
repositories deleted, so the whole line lives in one place. Git mirrors taken before deletion are
outside the repo, in the author's own backups.

| # | Name | Dates | Approach | Why it was superseded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [`01-agent-junction/`](01-agent-junction/) | 2026-02-17 → 2026-04-10 | **The first iteration.** TypeScript MCP server: an encrypted (AES-256-GCM), in-memory, read-once message bus on localhost or the LAN. Agents `register`, get an alias, `list_peers`, `send_message`, `read_messages`. An Electron monitor app came later. Published to npm as `agent-junction` 0.1.0. | A synchronous meeting place: both agents must be connected at the same time, a server must be running, and messages vanish on read or disconnect. Most real hand-offs are asynchronous. |
| 2 | [`02-agent-relay/`](02-agent-relay/) | 2026-05-03 → 2026-07-23 | Python FastMCP relay with SQLite sessions and a content-addressed blob store, so agents on different LAN machines could exchange messages **and files**. Shipped as the `agent-relay` plugin (8 skills). | Still a server to deploy and keep running, and a roster of client IDs to maintain, for what turned out to be mostly "leave a note for later". |
| 3 | Claude-Breakout (this repo's former name) | 2026-08-12 | Built on Claude Code's native cross-session `SendMessage` (2.1.224). An idea that does not belong in the current repo gets a new repo, a seed brief on disk, and a pinged second agent. | Native messaging made the bus unnecessary, but covered one case (founding a repo) and needed the receiver to be running. |
| 4 | dead-drop (current) | 2026-10-22 | A markdown file in the **target repo's** `a2a/` folder, with a SessionStart hook, reminders, and living messages. `SendMessage` is only the doorbell. Breakout is now one message kind. | — |

The direction across all four: from a live channel both sides must join, towards a durable note
in the place the reader already works.

## What is in these folders

Each folder is the original repository's tracked files at its last commit, with these changes:

- `package-lock.json` files, the banner image and the `.claude/` folder were left out.
- Skill folders are renamed `skills.retired/` and each `SKILL.md` is renamed `SKILL.retired.md`,
  and agent-relay's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is kept as `plugin.json.retired`. This stops
  plugin loaders and skill indexers from picking these up as live skills.

The code is kept as reference, not maintained. If you need a **synchronous** channel, or one that
works for agentic CLIs other than Claude Code, Agent Junction is still the better starting point:
dead-drop assumes Claude Code on both ends.
